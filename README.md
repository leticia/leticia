Hi, Leticia here!

- I’m a Biomedical Informatics student and software developer from Brazil 📚 👩‍💻 🇧🇷

- I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to Bioinformatics, Epidemiological Surveillance and data analysis, in general 📈

- I’m interested in Public Health and next-gen Government Technology 🏥 🏛️

- My favorite areas in Health are Genetics, Epidemiology, Immunology and Microbiology (it's a *lot* to study) 🧬

- I'm perfecting my Python and R skills and trying to find time to learn Julia 🌱

- I worked in both private and public sectors, in different Technology domains 💻

I'm not a heavy social media user, but, if you feel the need to contact me, you can do it at [hi@lele.rocks](mailto:hi@lele.rocks) - it's an email, I know. 📬
