Hello, Leticia here! 👋

I’m a Biomedical Informatics undergrad student (UFCSPA) and software developer from Brazil looking to collaborate on projects related to Bioinformatics. 💻 🧬 🇧🇷

My favorite areas in Health are Genetics, Immunology and Women's Health (it's a *lot* to study). My goal is to study Immunogenetics in endometriosis, applying Bioinformatics approaches. 🧪🔬

I'm also a software developer with a background in both public and private sectors. I'm familiar with Python, Ruby, Shell Scripting, different programming paradigms and tools. Always open to collaborate on meaningful projects at the intersection of Biology and Technology. 👩‍💻

Some other interests of mine:

- Public Health and next-gen Government Technology 🏥 🏛️
- Statistics and Mathematics in the context of Machine Learning (I'm afraid I cannot say I'm gifted at these areas) 📈 📊
- Epistemology 🌱

I'm not a heavy social media user, but, if you feel the need to contact me, you can do it at [hi@lele.rocks](mailto:hi@lele.rocks) - it's an email, I know. 📬
